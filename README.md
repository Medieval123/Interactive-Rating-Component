## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox




### What I learned
Gained a little experience as this is my first project I'm taking that involved only my current knowledge and skills.




### Continued development

- Would love to add an overlay to the submit button so i would not have to reload the site to go back to the rating component
- Add a suitable Error gif animation when no score is selected on submit
